# Extra Apparel
=============

Adds additional clothing items to your game!  
  
**Disclaimer:** _This pack is currently in development, but includes some simple proof-of-concept content to demonstrate what else there is to add!_  
  
This pack allows you to add an extra layer of personal flair to your player with custom apparel items. while only the resource pack is needed for the custom apparel to work, the datapack allows certain items to be craftable or available through wandering traders.

I aim to have this pack have as small a filesize as possible in the event anyone wishes to use this on a server.
